# Discord-AppImage
AppImage builds for [Discord Stable, Discord PTB, and Discord Canary](https://discord.com).  These AppImages are built using the [discord-appimage.sh](https://github.com/simoniz0r/Discord-AppImage/blob/master/discord-appimage.sh) script with dependencies pulled from Ubuntu 18.04's repositories.

To use an AppImage, just download it, `chmod a+x` the AppImage file, then run it!

The AppImage builds provided here will automatically update themselves whenever a new version of Discord is released.

[Download AppImage from the releases page](https://github.com/simoniz0r/Discord-AppImage/releases)
