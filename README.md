# Discord-AppImage
AppImage builds for [Discord Stable, Discord PTB, and Discord Canary](https://discord.com).  These AppImages are built using the [discord-appimage.sh](https://github.com/simoniz0r/Discord-AppImage/blob/master/discord-appimage.sh) script with dependencies pulled from Ubuntu 20.04's repositories.

To use an AppImage, just download it, `chmod a+x` the AppImage file, then run it!

The AppImages listed on [the releases page](https://github.com/simoniz0r/Discord-AppImage/releases) do not actually contain the Discord client, but will build the full AppImage containing the client on first run.  After the full AppImage has been built, the AppImage downloaded from [the releases page](https://github.com/simoniz0r/Discord-AppImage/releases) can be deleted.
